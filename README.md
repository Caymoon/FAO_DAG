# FAO_DAG

The simplest way to use matrix-free CVXPY and matrix-free cone solvers is to clone the matrix-free CVXPY [repository here](https://github.com/SteveDiamond/cvxpy) and the matrix-free SCS [repository here](https://github.com/SteveDiamond/scs) and install the packages from source.

TODO
this should pull in matrix-free cvxpy and scs.
TODO installation instructions
TODO fix sparse matrix multiplication
TODO add 2D convolution
TODO store results on edges
